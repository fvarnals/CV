## Freddie Varnals

I am a highly curious and enthusiastic individual, with a long standing passion for the Sciences, data analytics, and problem solving. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have always relished in and thrived on asking difficult questions and using data to find empirically justified answers. 

I am at my best when applying lateral thinking to problem solving, and get a huge buzz from finding solutions to complex problems. I am most excited by the intersection between Machine Learning and Software, and would love to apply and further develop my knowledge and skills in a professional environment.

### Skills

#### *Automation and Innovation*
- Developed a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/strawberry-alarm-clock" target="blank">Smart Alarm Clock</a> for Android where the user sets arrival time rather than wakeup time, adjusting alarm time based on journey delays.

- Added feature automatically sets the alarm song to match the weather forecast for wakeup time and location.

- Independently automated calculation of promotional pricing for my team at Amazon using Excel VBA Macros and SQL, improving efficiency and reducing pricing errors. 

- Created an Excel deck to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

#### *Self-led Learning*

- Currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/Idling-Engines-Audio-Recognition" target="blank">Machine Learning</a> project to classify urban sounds, specifically to detect idling engines in the hope that it could be employed in tackling offending vehicles as part of the recent government initiatives to impose "no idling" zones.

- Independently taught myself coding, datascience and deep learning techinques from scratch (using Coursera, Learn Python the Hard Way and Datacamp as well as numerous forums and blogs).

- Completed an intensive 4-month Software Development bootcamp with Makers, where I have learnt OOP, TDD, Agile Software Development, Pair Programming, and Project Work in a heavily self-learning based curriculum.

#### *Analytical*
- Critical business analysis for brands, utilising key metrics such as revenue, availability, conversions, and brand exposure; **both brands grew above category average.** 

- Testing and analysis of behavioural statistics relating to customer browsing and web interaction.

- Developed new animal model of Depression, using rodent interaction with touchscreens to gather and analyse large volumes of behavioural data.

- Collated and processed large experimental datasets, to identify pertinent variables for analysis using IBM SPSS.



#### *Teamwork and Managing Relationships*
- Formulated anonymous aggregated feedback for project work in order to address issues with teamwork skills and communication at Makers Academy.

- Coordinated with CJO to organize a workshop to facilitate team relationships.

- Six weeks of afternoon pair programming, followed by five weeks of team project work.

- Ran workshops at Amazon to support my team with regards to catalogue work, to promote individual proficiency with regards to lower level tasks in order to improve operational efficiency. 

- Quarterly business reviews presented to both internal and external senior management, providing broad and 
comprehensive analysis to inform stakeholders of progress, strategy, and my performance. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2019 to September 2019)

- Self-learning new languages, frameworks and databases
- Experience in pairing, team and individual work
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React Native, SQL
- OOP, TDD, MVC, BDD
- Agile/XP
- RSpec, Jasmine, jQuery, Jest, Enzyme

#### University of Bristol (2013 to 2014)

- Biomedical Sciences Research MSc (**Distinction**)
- Developed a new method of screening antidepressant pharmaceuticals in rats, using a touch screen based task. Research aimed to develop and validate two novel animal models of depression in tandem, one with on-line recording of data for deep analysis.

#### University of Bristol (2009-2012)

- Chemistry BSc

#### Other Qualifications

##### Stanford Machine Learning - Coursera (Oct 2018 - Dec 2018)
100% Passing Grade
**A comprehensive course teaching theory as well as practical application of machine learning algorithms, from
Linear Regression to Artificial Neural Networks, with weekly graded exams and programming assignments.**
- Built Spam Classifier in order to automate classification of junk emails.
- Built recommender system to provide watch-list suggestions to users based on their ratings of other movies, using a
collaborative filtering algorithm.
- Best practices in Machine Learning - Evaluating a hypothesis, calculation of test set errors, using learning curves to
identify high bias/under-fitting vs high variance/over-fitting data issues and how to deal with these.

## Experience

**Amazon UK** (Jun 2015 to Feb 2017)    
*Strategic Brand Consultancy*  
**An extremely dynamic and demanding role primarily divided between - business consultancy for international 
brands, and internal optimisation of core business procedures through automation and innovation.**


**Amazon UK** (Dec 2014 to Jun 2015)   
*Catalogue Consultancy*  
**Consultancy service to ~30 brands in order to improve brand exposure and efficacy of display, employing a wide
range of specific novel analytical tools.**


## Hobbies
- I have a deep interest in Neuroscience and Pharmacology, specifically Psychopharmacology, and would love to apply softwarer development and datascience skills in this field.
- I am passionate about cooking, travelling and diving. 
- I am fascinated by Philosophy and Theology, and often attend salons where we get together to discuss the most recondite social, political and philosophical issues for fun and personal development.
