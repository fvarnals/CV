## Freddie Varnals

I am a naturally curious and enthusiastic individual, with a long standing passion for data analytics in a variety of fields.
Throughout my academic and professional career, I have always thrived and relished in asking difficult questions and
using data to find empirically justified answers. I am at my best when applying lateral thinking to problem solving, and
get a huge buzz from producing solutions to complex problems. As such, having decided to steer my career further in
this direction, I have independently taught myself coding, datascience and deep learning techinques from scratch; I
cannot wait to apply and further develop my knowledge and skills in a professional environment.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Analytical

- Amazon UK (2014-2017)
- Regular critical analysis for brands, deep-diving into performance, to identify growth opportunities, utilising key
metrics such as revenue, availability, conversions, and brand exposure – both brands grew above category average.
- Utilised Excel Macros and SQL to automate promotional pricing, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- Created Excel deck to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time
consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2019 to September 2019)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (2013 to 2014)

- Biomedical Sciences Research MSc
- Distinction
- Helped to develop a new method of screening antidepressant pharmaceuticals in rats, using a touch screen based task Research aimed to develop and validate two novel animal models of depression in tandem, one usinwith on-line recording of data for deep analysis.

#### University of Bristol (2009-2012)

- Chemistry BSc
- Second Class Honours (2:2)

#### Other Qualifications

##### Stanford Machine Learning - Coursera (Dec 2012 - 
100% Passing Grade
Machine Learning, Stanford Andrew Ng Course (Coursera) – Grade 100%
A comprehensive course teaching theory as well as practical application of machine learning algorithms, from
Linear Regression to Artificial Neural Networks, with weekly graded exams and programming assignments.
 Taught algorithms including: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector
Machines, K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering.
 Built Artificial Neural Network algorithm for handwritten digit recognition.
 Built recommender system to provide watch-list suggestions to users based on their ratings of other movies, using a
collaborative filtering algorithm.
 Built Spam Classifier in order to automate classification of junk emails.
 Best practices in Machine Learning - Evaluating a hypothesis, calculation of test set errors, using learning curves to
identify high bias/under-fitting vs high variance/over-fitting data issues and how to deal with these.
