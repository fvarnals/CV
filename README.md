## Freddie Varnals

*I am a highly curious and enthusiastic individual, with a long standing passion for the Sciences, Data Analytics, and problem solving. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have always relished in and thrived on asking difficult questions and using data to find empirically justified answers.* 

*I am at my best when applying lateral thinking to problem solving, and get a huge buzz from finding solutions to complex problems. I am most excited by the intersection between Machine Learning and Software, and would love to apply and further develop my knowledge and skills in a professional environment.*

### Skills

#### *Automation and Innovation*
- Developed a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/strawberry-alarm-clock" target="blank">Smart Alarm Clock</a> for Android where the user sets arrival time rather than wakeup time, adjusting alarm time based on journey delays.

- Added feature automatically sets the alarm song to match the weather forecast for wakeup time and location.

- Automated promotional pricing for my team at Amazon, reducing errors and saving up to 20 hours of work per week.

- Created an Excel deck to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

#### *Self-led Learning*

- Currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/Idling-Engines-Audio-Recognition" target="blank">Machine Learning</a> project to classify urban sounds, specifically to detect idling engines in the hope that it could be employed in tackling offending vehicles as part of the recent government initiatives to impose "no idling" zones.

- Taught myself React Native and Android Studio in a few days, to build Smart Alarm Clock App for final project. 

- Completed an intensive 4-month Software Development bootcamp with Makers Academy, where I have learnt to code in multiple languages, using a variety of frameworks in a self-learning based curriculum.

#### *Analytical*

-  Conducted critical business analysis for brands, utilising key metrics such as revenue, availability, conversions, and brand exposure; **both brands grew above category average.** 

- Tested and analysed behavioural statistics relating to customer browsing and web interaction.

- Developed new animal model of Depression, using rodent interaction with touchscreens to gather and analyse large volumes of behavioural data.

- Collated and processed large experimental datasets, to identify pertinent variables for analysis using IBM SPSS.



#### *Teamwork and Managing Relationships*
- Formulated anonymous aggregated feedback for project work in order to address issues with teamwork skills and communication at Makers Academy.

- Six weeks of afternoon pair programming, followed by five weeks of team project work.

- Negotiated and coordinated highest grossing Black Friday promotion in my category, generating over £800k in revenue.

- Ran workshops at Amazon to support team by promoting individual proficiency in lower level tasks in order to improve operational efficiency. 

- Presented quarterly business review to both internal and external senior management, providing broad and comprehensive analysis to inform stakeholders of progress, strategy, and my performance.
