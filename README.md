## Freddie Varnals

I am a naturally curious and enthusiastic individual, with a long standing passion for data analytics in a variety of fields.
Throughout my academic and professional career, I have always thrived and relished in asking difficult questions and
using data to find empirically justified answers. I am at my best when applying lateral thinking to problem solving, and
get a huge buzz from producing solutions to complex problems. As such, having decided to steer my career further in
this direction, I have independently taught myself coding, datascience and deep learning techinques from scratch; I
cannot wait to apply and further develop my knowledge and skills in a professional environment.

## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### Analytical

- Amazon UK (2014-2017)
- Regular critical analysis for brands, deep-diving into performance, to identify growth opportunities, utilising key
metrics such as revenue, availability, conversions, and brand exposure – both brands grew above category average.
- Utilised Excel Macros and SQL to automate promotional pricing, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- Created Excel deck to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time
consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (May 2019 to September 2019)

- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (2013 to 2014)

- Biomedical Sciences Research MSc
- Distinction
- Helped to develop a new method of screening antidepressant pharmaceuticals in rats, using a touch screen based task Research aimed to develop and validate two novel animal models of depression in tandem, one usinwith on-line recording of data for deep analysis.

#### University of Bristol (2009-2012)

- Chemistry BSc
- Second Class Honours (2:2)

#### Other Qualifications

##### Stanford Machine Learning - Coursera (Oct 2018 - Dec 2018)
100% Passing Grade
A comprehensive course teaching theory as well as practical application of machine learning algorithms, from
Linear Regression to Artificial Neural Networks, with weekly graded exams and programming assignments.
- Taught algorithms including: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector
Machines, K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering.
- Built Artificial Neural Network algorithm for handwritten digit recognition.
- Built recommender system to provide watch-list suggestions to users based on their ratings of other movies, using a
collaborative filtering algorithm.
- Built Spam Classifier in order to automate classification of junk emails.
- Best practices in Machine Learning - Evaluating a hypothesis, calculation of test set errors, using learning curves to
identify high bias/under-fitting vs high variance/over-fitting data issues and how to deal with these.

## Experience

**Amazon UK** (Jun 2015 to Feb 2017)    
*Strategic Brand Consultancy*  
- Testing and analysis of behavioural statistics relating to customer browsing and web interaction.
- Utilised SQL and VBA Macros to automate promotional pricing, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- Created Excel deck using VBA macros to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

**Amazon UK** (Dec 2014 to Jun 2015)   
*Catalogue Consultancy*  
- Consultancy service to ~30 brands in order to improve brand exposure and efficacy of display, employing a wide
range of specific novel analytical tools.
- Regular assessment of product catalogue data quality, presented to clients in clear, accessible analysis.
- Search engine optimisation and assessment of internal product categorisation in order to improve discoverability of
products for customers, and optimise exposure for brands.
- Used Excel Macros to build customised decks for team members to analyse key metrics and product catalogue data.
- Built deck to help new hires with understanding of internal tools – what to use when and how; where to find it.

## Hobbies

- In my spare time I have been trying to build a Computer Vision program for automated categorisation of photos in family albums based on the person/persons in each photo (using OpenCV and Python).
- I have also been working on a program using Keras to build a machine learning model for audio recognition of idling car engines, in the hope that it could be employed in tackling offending vehicles as part of the recent government initiatives to impose "no idling" zones. For this I have had to learn how to use the Fast Fourier Transform in order to pull significant wavelengths from 2 channel audio data, and then build and train a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Tensor Flow. 
- I have a deep interest in Neuroscience and Pharmacology, specifically Psychopharmacology, and would love to apply softwarer development and datascience skills in this field.
- I am passionate about cooking, travelling and diving. 
- I am fascinated by Philosophy and Theology, and often attend salons where we get together to discuss the most recondite social, political and philosophical issues -  for fun!
