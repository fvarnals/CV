## Freddie Varnals

I am a naturally curious and enthusiastic individual, with a long standing passion for the Sciences, data analytics, and problem solving. 

Throughout my academic and professional career, I have always relished in and thrived on asking difficult questions, and using data to find empirically justified answers. I am at my best when applying lateral thinking to problem solving, and get a huge buzz from finding solutions to complex problems.

I have independently taught myself coding, datascience and deep learning techinques from scratch, and have recently completed an intensive 4-month Software Development bootcamp with Makers, where I have learnt OOP, TDD, Agile Software Development, Pair Programming, and Project Work in a heavily self-learning based curriculum.

### Skills

#### *Automation and Innovation*
- Developed a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/strawberry-alarm-clock" target="blank">Smart Alarm Clock</a> for Android where the user sets arrival time rather than wakeup time, adjusting alarm time based on journey delays.

- Added feature automatically sets the alarm song to match the weather forecast for wakeup time and location.

- Independently automated calculation of promotional pricing for my team at Amazon using Excel VBA Macros and SQL, improving efficiency and reducing pricing errors. 

- Created an Excel deck to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

#### *Analytical*
- Currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/fvarnals/Idling-Engines-Audio-Recognition" target="blank">Machine Learning</a> project to classify urban sounds, specifically to detect idling engines.

- Testing and analysis of behavioural statistics relating to customer browsing and web interaction.

- Developed new animal model of Depression, using rodent interaction with touchscreens to gather and analyse large volumes of behavioural data.

- Collated and processed large experimental datasets, to identify pertinent variables for analysis using IBM SPSS. 

#### *Teamwork and Managing Relationships*
- Formulated anonymous aggregated feedback for project work in order to address issues with teamwork skills and communication at Makers Academy.

- Coordinated with CJO to organize a workshop to facilitate team relationships.

- Six weeks of afternoon pair programming, followed by five weeks of team project work.

- Ran workshops at Amazon to support my team with regards to catalogue work, to promote individual proficiency with regards to lower level tasks in order to improve operational efficiency.

#### Other Qualifications

##### Stanford Machine Learning - Coursera (Oct 2018 - Dec 2018)
100% Passing Grade
A comprehensive course teaching theory as well as practical application of machine learning algorithms, from
Linear Regression to Artificial Neural Networks, with weekly graded exams and programming assignments.
- Taught algorithms including: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector
Machines, K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Anomaly Detection and Collaborative Filtering.
- Built Artificial Neural Network algorithm for handwritten digit recognition.
- Built recommender system to provide watch-list suggestions to users based on their ratings of other movies, using a
collaborative filtering algorithm.
- Built Spam Classifier in order to automate classification of junk emails.
- Best practices in Machine Learning - Evaluating a hypothesis, calculation of test set errors, using learning curves to
identify high bias/under-fitting vs high variance/over-fitting data issues and how to deal with these.

## Experience

**Amazon UK** (Jun 2015 to Feb 2017)    
*Strategic Brand Consultancy*  
- Testing and analysis of behavioural statistics relating to customer browsing and web interaction.
- Utilised SQL and VBA Macros to automate promotional pricing, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
- Created Excel deck using VBA macros to flag issues relating to key product metrics (i.e. stock and pricing issues), avoiding time consuming manual processing, and avoiding missed opportunities.

**Amazon UK** (Dec 2014 to Jun 2015)   
*Catalogue Consultancy*  
- Consultancy service to ~30 brands in order to improve brand exposure and efficacy of display, employing a wide
range of specific novel analytical tools.
- Regular assessment of product catalogue data quality, presented to clients in clear, accessible analysis.
- Search engine optimisation and assessment of internal product categorisation in order to improve discoverability of
products for customers, and optimise exposure for brands.
- Used Excel Macros to build customised decks for team members to analyse key metrics and product catalogue data.
- Built deck to help new hires with understanding of internal tools â€“ what to use when and how; where to find it.

## Hobbies

- In my spare time I have been trying to build a Computer Vision program for automated categorisation of photos in family albums based on the person/persons in each photo (using OpenCV and Python).
- I have also been working on a program using Keras to build a machine learning model for audio recognition of idling car engines, in the hope that it could be employed in tackling offending vehicles as part of the recent government initiatives to impose "no idling" zones. For this I have had to learn how to use the Fast Fourier Transform in order to pull significant wavelengths from 2 channel audio data, and then build and train a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and Tensor Flow. 
- I have a deep interest in Neuroscience and Pharmacology, specifically Psychopharmacology, and would love to apply softwarer development and datascience skills in this field.
- I am passionate about cooking, travelling and diving. 
- I am fascinated by Philosophy and Theology, and often attend salons where we get together to discuss the most recondite social, political and philosophical issues -  for fun!
